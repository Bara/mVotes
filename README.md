# mVotes
It has currently no function just create vote with [CreatePoll](https://github.com/Bara/mVotes/blob/master/mvotes/stocks.sp#L63).

Polls and Options are cached in an array to increase performance and reduce mysql usage (instead of SELECT all polls+options on every menu everytime).

## ToDo
 - Print message to all players on new poll
 - Uhm... too much to list all things

## Known issues
 - It's currently a dev version, bugs are welcome

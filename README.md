# mVotes
Polls and Options are cached in an array to increase performance and reduce mysql usage (instead of SELECT all polls+options on every menu everytime).

## ToDo
 - Natives:
  - Close polls
  - Extend polls
 - Enable/Disable Revoting

## Known issues
 - It's currently a dev version, bugs are welcome

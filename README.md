Polls and Options are cached in an array to increase performance and reduce mysql usage (instead of SELECT all polls+options on every menu everytime).

## ToDo
 - Command to close polls

## Which features will not added (except anyone do it)
 - Change of title/options
   - I want to prevent faked results
 - Reactive of expired polls
   - Just create a new one

## Known issues
 - It's currently a alpha version, bugs are welcome

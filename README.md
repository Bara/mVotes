# mVotes
This plugin is a standalone polls plugin. Admins with the vote flag can create, extend and close polls with a pretty easy to use menu. It's also possible to give multiple votes on one poll. All data and results are saved in a mysql database. Active polls, options and votes are cached as enum struct in a arraylist to increase the performance without many mysql queries.

## ToDo

## Which features will not added (except anyone do it)
